===========Mobile Contact Export =================
This is a quick app I wrote to export contacts from my Nokia E70 in vcard format so I could import them into my new Android phone, the HTC Desire or Nexus One else where in the world. 

The app will ask you where to export the vcards to on your device and then create a separate card for each contact. Using bluetooth or wireless access you can then copy the files off the cell/mobile and import them into your email client.
